				in Edmonton, we are passionate about what we do. All of our teachers have a depth of experience that
				they bring to each class and workshop. We don't have a one-size-fits-all approach, you will be seen,
				heard and valued in our warm and welcoming environment. We are a relaxing sanctuary amidst the hustle
				and bustle of downtown Edmonton, and your busy lives. It is our hope that you will find: improved
				physical athletic ability, increased flexibility, better sleep, increased cardiovascular endurance,

			<h2>Yoga House Rules</h2>
			<p>The homey atmosphere creates a soothing environment which sets you at ease at once. We are a smaller one
				room studio, which means smaller class sizes and more hands on instruction, with personal interaction.
			</p>

			<p>The yoga room is silent before, during and after class. During the class, the instructor is the only one
				speaking. There are some general etiquette guidelines to follow in the studio: </p>

			<ul>
				<li>With respect to those sensitive to fragrances we ask that you refrain from wearing strong scents. We
					also refrain from burning incense. </li>

				<li>We ask you to be mindful of others at the studio if you plan on attending class please be on time to
					respect the sacred place of others. </li>

				<li>The instruction is verbal and very technical with no demonstrations. It is very important that you
					are actively listening to the instructor throughout class and allow others the same courtesy. </li>

				<li>There are no shoes in the studio. Please be aware that you’ll be barefoot in the yoga room—any
					contagious foot conditions should be treated as soon as possible or covered/dressed while walking
					through the studio. </li>

				<li>Please bring only your mat, towel and water into the room. Do not bring purses, wallets, phones or
					other distractions. Due to the heat and humidity in the room, these types of items could be damaged
					and may pose as a distraction. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Spring Yin Workshop</h3>
				<p>It happens every spring. This year’s Spring Yin Workshop will be with Tori Lunden on Saturday, May
					28, 2016 from 2:15pm - 4:15pm. After the joy and jubilation of being able to play outside comes the
					aches and pains in areas we forgot we had. It comes as a bit of a shock to our bodies this shift to
					suddenly gardening, biking, running, hiking, along with all the other outdoor activities we love.
					Even for those that stay active through the winter; the spring is often accompanied by stiff muscles
					and creaky joints.</p>

				<p>This extended practice will help our bodies through this rocky transition with a combination of
					gentle movement and passive, supported stretches for the shoulders, back, and hips. Take two hours
					to relax and restore so you can get on with enjoying our beautiful Edmonton summer. </p>

				<p>This practice is suitable for beginners, experienced students, and especially beneficial for those
					with active lifestyles. The cost will be $30 (includes GST). Please register in advance at
					http://www.shantillyyogastudio.ca/events or call 780-421-9444</p>

				<p>Tori's classes are always a fun and eclectic environment. She delights in teaching people who, like
					her, never thought yoga was something they could do let alone enjoy. Tori has a degree in social
					work from the University of Calgary and has been teaching yoga since 2008; when she would never
					again work anywhere that required her to sit for eight hours a day.</p>

				<h3>Clothing Swap</h3>
				<p>We’re having a Clothing Swap at the studio on Saturday, April 16, 2016 from 2:15pm - 4:15pm. Bring us
					your worn but still awesome cloths and in exchange take home a new spring wardrobe! This of course
					extends to shoes, jewelry, books... (then stay and check out the new class ;) </p>

				<p>The clothing swaps are a great community event! Come and chat with those faces you see in classes,
					but maybe have never talked to. It it's a nice day we can hang out on the roof and have tea! If you
					don't have anything to exchange, come and sift through the piles and take home some treasures. If
					you can't stay feel free to drop things off. </p>

				<p>Everything left over will get donated! </p>

			<h2>How to choose the best class</h2>
			<p>With so many different options, which is the best class for me? </p>

			<p>Most of our classes are appropriate for all levels. No matter what class you take, our teachers are adept
				at modifying for each individual. All of the classes are taught from a foundation of healthy alignment
				with a focus on improving mobility and stability, while developing self-awareness through movement,
				postures and breath.</p>

			<h3>Yin, Restorative Yoga, Yoga for Backs Class</h3>
			<p>Yin, Restorative Yoga, Yoga for Backs will be the classes for you. Gentle movements, using props to
				support and nurture you at a slower pace to calm your mind and body. Students can relieve the tension
				and stresses of daily lives as well as working without the pressure of working beyond their comfort
				level. Designed to decrease pain and discomfort of a neglected body or one recovering from injury,
				allowing you to work toward regaining strength and flexibility.</p>

			<h3>Flow Class </h3>
			<p>The flow classes continuously move your body integrating strength and flexibility in a non-stop shift
				from posture to posture. The flow classes vary from slower basic movements to progressively more
				advanced. We support slower movements and believe in the healing aspects associated with the ability to
				slow down and stay present. Our teachers encourage a mindful state to practice from, which supports
				healing physically, emotionally and spiritually. </p>
