            <h2>Creating Navigational Links within a web site</h2>
            <p>There are several techniques to navigating within a web site. The semantic tag for navigation is the
                &lt;nav&gt; tag.
                You can navigate through your website by using relative addressing. For our examples we will use the
                unordered list tag &(lt;UL&gt;). Our examples will consist of:

            <ul>
                <li>page to page within the same folder</li>
                <li>page to page between folders</li>
                <li>staying on the current page</li>
                <li>going to a specific place on the current page (on page navigation)</li>
                <li>going to a specific place on the another page</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Navigational menus are placed in your &lt;header&gt; semantic area. They may also be placed in your
                &lt;footer&gt; area</p>
