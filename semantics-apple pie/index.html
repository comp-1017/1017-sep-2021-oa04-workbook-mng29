            <h2>Choosing the Best Apples for Pies</h2>
            <p>So what is the best apple for apple pie? Well this question can start a fight in any kitchen. So you want
                a tart and tangy apple with a firm flesh. Maybe you like a splash of sweetness or maybe a firm fleshy
                apple is more to your liking. When it comes to choosing your apple for Grandmas apple pie we recommend
                using Granny Smith, Honeycrisp or Mutsu</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>
                    Granny Smith Apples
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Granny Smith apples are generally thought of as the go-to baking apple, but in the BA test kitchen,
                    we have a few favorites that hold up under heat and balance sweet-tart flavor. Try them when youâ€™re
                    ready to branch out.

                    Honeycrisp Apples
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Honeycrisp is our desert-island apple. Its shatteringly crisp texture is guaranteed to hold firm
                    when baked or caramelized, such as in our Apple-Molasses Upside-Down Cake or an elegant Tarte tatin.

                    Mutsu Apples
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Mutsu also known as Crispin, this firm-fleshed, less tart option is similar in flavor to a Golden
                    Delicious. Great for pies or other recipes that call for gentle cooking.
