    <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
    <!-- This is the coding block for your content on your webpage -->

    <p> The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line
        in your displayed web page on the browser. The browser does NOT display
        your context in the physical style of how you have entered your code in your
        html file.
    </p>

    <p> This is my second paragraph on the displayed browser page. It will start a
        new line.
    </p>

    <!--If you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the whole tag) you would 
        be in trouble just using the tag
        YOU CAN USE SPECIAL CHARACTERS STRINGS TO REPRESENT COMPONENTS OF A TAG.  
        such as the < (&lt) and the > (&gt) symbol-->
    <h3>List Tags &lt;OL&gt; and &lt;UL&gt;</h3>

            be updated
        </li>

    <!--This is an anchor tag, often reffered to as the link tag.
        One should not use the term link tag because there is actually a <link> tag
        used in the <head> function.
        This tag can take yyou to a different location whether it be a different
        website, different page in the current website, or a different position on
        the current page.
    
        Parameters HREF points to the desired location
                   TARGET indicates the browser page display option (new tab, position)
                    - default is the same page
